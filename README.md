# Adobe-Runtime-Support

This project acts as an **issue tracker** for bugs and feature requests connected to the *AIR SDK and Runtime*.
It does not contain any source code.

The [old issue tracker](https://tracker.adobe.com) is rather cumbersome and limited. 
For example, it's really hard to search through tickets, so bugs often get reported repeatedly; as a result, they often don't get the attention they deserve.

Now that Harman has taken over AIR development, we need a new place to discuss and report problems and make sure they know what's relevant to the community! 
That's what this new issue tracker is all about.

## I found a bug in the runtime! What do do?!

First of all, use the search feature to find out if somebody already reported a similar issue.
Also have a look at the [discussions section](https://github.com/Gamua/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions)!

### a) This issue was already reported.

* Vote for that issue. To do that, click on the "Add your reaction" button at the top of the issue description and click on the :+1: symbol.
* If possible, provide additional information by adding a comment.

### b) This is a new issue.

* Create a [new issue](https://github.com/Gamua/Adobe-Runtime-Support/issues/new) in this repository.
* A template will pop up that will help you collect all necessary information.
* Only a problem that can be reproduced has a chance of being fixed! Thus, create a minimal sample and provide all the information needed to get it running.
* I can't stress this enough: the easier you make it for Harman to recreate the problem, the higher your chances of a fix!

## I've got a question I can't answer.

* Do **not** open up a new issue. Instead,
* head over to the [discussions section](https://github.com/Gamua/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions) and ask your question there.
